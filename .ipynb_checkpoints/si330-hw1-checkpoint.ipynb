    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Due: Friday, January 19, 2018,  11:59:00pm\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submission instructions\n",
    "After completing this homework, you will turn in two files via Canvas ->  Assignments -> Homework 1:\n",
    "Your Notebook, named si330-hw1-YOUR_UNIQUE_NAME.ipynb and\n",
    "the HTML file, named si330-hw1-YOUR_UNIQUE_NAME.html\n",

    "## Objectives\n",
    "After completing this homework assignment, you should know how to\n",
    "* use compound data structures\n",
    "* perform simple and complex sorting\n",
    "* use lambda functions\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, this assignment will provide an opportunity to work with a large (100,000 row) data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) are a popular way for people to learn new skills.  The University of Michigan\n",
    "offers many different MOOCs, which are produced by faculty members and supported by the Office of Academic \n",
    "Innovation.\n",
    "\n",
    "MOOCs tend to be used by hundreds to hundreds of thousands of users.  These users leave \"digital exhaust\" when\n",
    "they work through the MOOC in the form of web server log entries.  We have obtained a small sample of these data\n",
    "files from Prof. Chris Brooks, who is a colleague here at UMSI.  The data files are de-identified: anything\n",
    "that could identify a person, such as their UMID or their IP address are \"hashed\" (encrypted).  Each line in the\n",
    "data file represents a \"page view\" by a user.  The schema for each line is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```umich_user_id, hashed_session_cookie_id, server_timestamp, hashed_ip, user_agent, url, initial_referrer_url, rowser_language, course_id, country_cd, region_cd, timezone, os, browser, key, value```\n",
    "\n",
    "Of note is the ```UMICH_USER_ID```, which identifies each user, and ```HASHED_SESSION_COOKIE_ID``` which identifies a session.\n",
    "Sessions are important:  they represent a collection of pageviews between the time that a user logs in and,\n",
    "usually, when they log out.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've already used the \"mooc_small.csv\" file in our lab.  We recommend that you continue to use that file for your\n",
    "development work and then switch to the \"mooc_big.csv\" file (which contains 100,000 lines of data) for your\n",
    "final analysis.  **Note that you must use the mooc_big.csv file for the work you submit.** \n",
    "\n",
    "In the lab, we went through the motions of some manipulation of the MOOC log data.  For this assignment, we'll be\n",
    "asking three real-world questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How many different countries (based on ```COUNTRY_CD```) are represented in the data file?\n",
    "2. Which countries do most of the page views come from?\n",
    "3. For people accessing the MOOC from the US, what is the average number of page views per session?\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the MOOC data file, you're also going to use a file called ```countrycodes.tsv``` to map\n",
    "2-digit country codes to the full name of the country.  Why?  Because not everyone knows that PF is \n",
    "\"French Polynesia\"."
